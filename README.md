## Welcome to BirdPlanner! ðŸ¦†

This is a little project I put together to make make planning for birding trips a lot easier. It allows you to save hotspots, add notes, view world targets at a hotspot with one click, save custom markers, view targets in the region, and view recent reports of your targets.
